# Dash ui react components

- React components build with radix-ui, stitches, typesafe.
- This project uses turborepo as task runner.
- This is mostly used in my personal projects.
- Ui consists of basic components and a data grid. https://github.com/vishal2457/dashui/tree/main/packages/dash-core/src/DataGrid
